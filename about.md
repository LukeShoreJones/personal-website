title: About Me
---
Hi! I'm a second year Computer Science student at the University of Liverpool.

I'm interested in pure and discrete mathematics, statistics and software
development. I work on a number of projects in my free time,
ranging from visual sorting algorithms to a neural network written from scratch.
All of my projects can be seen from the Projects page accessible on the sidebar.

I have also made games, such as a tactical roleplaying game you can find on this
site - these games are often inspired by games I enjoy playing in my free time. 
In particular, I enjoy playing online games where I can work with groups of people.

My favourite programming language is Python, but I also have experience in Java,
SQL, and Haskell. I am also familiar with HTML and CSS.

My GCSEs (2011-2016) and my A-Levels (2016-2018) were earned at West Derby
School. During my GCSEs, I earned 3 A* grades and 6 A grades, including an
A* in maths and A grades in English language and literature.

During my A-Levels, I earned a Distinction* in ICT, an A in maths and physics,
and a C in further maths.

In my first semester of university, I achieved an overall mark of 92%.

In 2016 I did work experience at Lowri Beck Systems, which was very useful, as
it showed me a variety of potential career paths.

In 2016 I earned my European Computer Driving License, and participated in
the NCS programme, where I took part in a group volunteering project. This
included helping the homeless (with food, hot drinks and warm clothes), packing
shopping bags to raise money for Woodlands Hospice, and volunteering in an old
people's home.
