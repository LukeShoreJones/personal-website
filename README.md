# My Personal Website
This is the source code for my personal website and portfolio, accessible at <https://lukeshorejones.github.io> and forked from GitHub's own personal website template. It includes my top repositories, sourced using the GitHub API, and my blog posts. The website is made using Jekyll, a static site generator.
