I'm back! It's been a day, and the website is looking a lot more fleshed out.
Now you can see more projects and blog posts in their dedicated directories,
which you can access from the list on the left-hand side of the screen. There,
you can also find my About Me page, which includes everything you could
*possibly* want to know about me. And then some, probably. Aaaannndd... that's
about it. There are a couple of other tweaks, but all in all the changes aren't
too dramatic. I'm still learning how Jekyll works, which means things take a
while for me to get working. But I learned a lot today, and I have to say it's
pretty cool! But for today, that's all. Time to relax for a while, and then the
battle will continue.

Thanks for reading,

Luke
